        <p>
            My name is Mosopefoluwa John. I'm a Math and Biology double major at Grambling State University.
            I am a passionate software developer with a keen interest in web development and data science.
            I have experience in various programming languages and frameworks, and I am always eager to learn new technologies.
            I'm also interested in machine learning, consulting, computational biology, and bioinformatics.
            In my spare time, I enjoy reading, watching YouTube videos, scrabble, and soccer.
